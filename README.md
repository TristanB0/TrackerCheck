# TrackerCheck

The goal of the project is to be able to check the tracker of any player
quickly from the Rocket League game.

On pressing `F7`, it will open a window with all the players sorted by team,
and a click on a pseudo will open the default browser of the user with the page
https://rocketleague.tracker.network on the selected profile.

**Why does this tool exist?** Some players want to check the activity of other
players, but they need to type the name of the target, and sometimes the
latter are using characters that are not printed correctly in the game,
resulting in the impossibility to check them. This is even more of an issue for
players using the Epic Games version of the game, as it is not possible to open
the Steam player profile and copy its ID.

In addition to the tracker, you can also open the Steam profile of any player
using this platform.

## TODO

- [ ] Fetch players only once when a game starts, and not when the key is pressed

- [ ] Save a history of the past few games
