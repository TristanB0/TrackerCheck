# TrackerCheck

**/!\ This tool is in EARLY development! (nearly stand-by) /!\\**

The goal of the project is to be able to check the tracker of any player quickly from the Rocket League game.

On pressing `F6`, it will open a window with all the players sorted by team, and a click on a pseudo will open the default browser of the user with the page https://rocketleague.tracker.network on the selected profile.

**Why does this tool exist?** Some players want to check the activity of other players, but they need to type the name of the other player, and sometimes the latter are using characters that are not printed correctly in the game, resulting in the impossibility to check them.

[ ] Create the base for the Back-End

[ ] Let the option of changing the key
